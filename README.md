# etcdjs-simple

A client to perform simple actions with etcd3 through HTTP gateway

# Why?

There is a js/ts client [mixer/etcd3](https://github.com/mixer/etcd3) that is full-featured and production-ready, but it's native gRPC dependency may cause trouble while compling.  
Please notice that only small features are supported.
